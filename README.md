# SpotifyAdBlocker
SpotifyAdBlocker is a small Android application that automatically mutes when Spotify is playing an advertisement.

# Installation Instructions

2. Install the SpotifyAdBlocker apk (You may need to enable Unknown Sources).
3. Open your Android settings, then "Security", and enable SpotifyAdBlocker.

# Setup Instructions
1. Enable blocking on SpotifyAdBlocker and start your music in Spotify.
2. Minimize Spotify (i.e go to your home screen or another app). The Spotify notification icon must be visible.
3. Enjoy your music without ads. You can lock your phone as long as the Spotify notification icon was visible.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute a feature or fix a bug you found in the app, you can open a pull request on Github. Something I would like done is change the app into a more generic auto-muter that can instead be configured to block Spotify ads, so that the app might be placed on the Google Play Store.
